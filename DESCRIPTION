Title: Cluster-robust (sandwich) variance estimators with small-sample corrections
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: clubSandwich provides several cluster-robust variance estimators 
    (i.e., sandwich estimators) for ordinary and weighted least squares linear regression models. 
    Several adjustments are incorporated to improve small-sample performance. 
    The package includes functions for estimating the variance-covariance matrix and 
    for testing single- and multiple-contrast hypotheses based on Wald test statistics. 
    Tests of single regression coefficients use Satterthwaite or saddlepoint corrections.
    Tests of multiple-contrast hypotheses use adjustments based on a Hotelling's T-squared
    approximation. Methods are provided for a variety of fitted models, including 
    lm, plm (from package plm), gls and lme (from nlme), robu (from robumeta), and 
    rma.uni and rma.mv (from metafor).
